        We won’t dismantle your furniture, so we recommend that you do that prior to your collection. However, we will pack and wrap your furniture securely to prepare it for transit and storage.<br>

Our dedicated team can collect stuff that can fit through your doors, and that be safely carried by two people, from any room in your home.

    <div id="me" class="collapse ms-3">
        If you order before 11am, you can order your collection for Monday to Saturday, 3 working days from the booking date. If you also need packing and order before 11am, you can order 4 working days from the booking date. The collection is expected to begin at 9am but a member of our customer team will be in touch to confirm the date and time once you have booked.

        No problem, don’t worry just take your best guess when you book your collection. We will check and confirm once we’ve collected your stuff. If you end up storing more, we’ll simply update your price accordingly and let you know. When selecting your unit size, you can also click on ‘What fits in here?’ We’ll give you a rough idea of the unit size in ft3 or the total amount of LOVESPACE boxes you can store per unit. If you’re not sure what unit size you need, check out our calculator which will tell you which unit will suit you.

    <div id="r" class="collapse ms-3">
        Your stuff will be kept safe and monitored 24/7 by CCTV in a secure storage facility. The safety of your stuff is our greatest priority which is why we work with best-in-class partners with decades of experience. We’ll choose a storage facility that’s suitable for the stuff we’re storing for you and one that’s local either to your collection or delivery address.

    <div id="b" class="collapse ms-3">
    <p>Yes. If you’re unsure what you’ve inside each box, we can audit your order.

        Checks that don’t require your box to be opened, such as checking the precise size of a box or other item, cost £3 per box and other item. All other audits or inventory checks cost £5 per box and other item.
        
        If you need us to create an inventory of your stuff, drop us an email.

    <div id="a" class="collapse ms-3">
    <p>Yes, you can store pretty much anything with us. What we’re able to store depends on where we’re collecting from which is why we ask you to input your collection postcode at the beginning of the order process. You can see a list of the few things we can’t store here.

        Where possible you’ll need to pack your stuff into a box. That goes for bags, suitcases and bikes. We sell specialist boxes for this stuff that you can order from us. Furniture doesn’t need to be in a box (that would be silly!) but we do need you to help us by wrapping it appropriately for transport. See here for further details.
        
        If you’ve got furniture or any other stuff that doesn’t fit into a box, you can always check out our storage units. We’ll be able to accommodate your request should you need more space. Just click here.
