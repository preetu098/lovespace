<div id="demo" class="collapse ms-3">
    Of course you can! We just ask that the boxes you choose are as sturdy as the ones we sell. They must be made of double-walled cardboard which means you should see at least two layers of zigzags when you look closely at the edge of the box.

    Please don’t risk damage to your stuff by using any old box. Never use boxes, like crisp boxes, which were originally intended for another purpose. Your box needs to be heavy-duty, so if it’s second-hand, it’s probably not suitable. LOVESPACE packing materials are double-walled and made of corrugated cardboard and are designed to handle up to 25kg of contents. You can see our full range of boxes and buy them here.

<div id="me" class="collapse ms-3">
    Yes, we always require you or your representative to be present during packing. We’ve packed for thousands of customer’s and we’ve learned that it’s the best way to ensure we pack precisely what you need us to.

    We will not take responsibility of what has (or hasn’t!) been packed on the day of collection. We’ll follow the instructions provided on the day.

<p class="ms-4 mt-3 " data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#m"><b>When can you collect my stuff?</b></p>
<div id="m" class="collapse ms-3">
    On our standard collection service your driver will be with you any time between 7am and 7pm on the date you request. So that we can collect your stuff, please ensure that you (or someone that you trust) is available for the full duration collection window. For most UK postcodes we’ll send you an 2-hours estimated collection time by email the day before your collection to help you plan your day.

    The cut-off time for next day collections is 11am the working day before. For Monday collections, please book before 11am the Friday before.
    
    From Monday to Saturday you can select a more specific timeslot for an extra charge.

<p class="ms-4 mt-3 " data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#c"><b>CWhere can you collect my stuff from?</b></p>
<div id="c" class="collapse ms-3">
    We can collect your stuff from any mainland UK address; be it your home address, a business address or your student halls of residence.

    To ensure a successful collection first time, make sure you enter your full address and an accurate postcode. It can also really help if you tell us that your home is in a gated complex and your driver will need to ring your buzzer for access, or if you’re leaving your stuff with a concierge, or in reception.
    
    Our standard collection service includes collection from the ground floor. Please make sure your stuff is packed and ready and waiting on the ground floor for your driver to collect.
    
    If you need extra assistance, we can offer a doorstep collection in most areas for an additional charge of £25.00. If you need this service get in touch with our friendly customer support team.

<div id="r" class="collapse ms-3">
    Unfortunately, we can’t guarantee that you’ll get a call from your driver, so we always try and make sure that we get as much detail as we can to make sure there aren’t any problems that would require a call. To ensure everything runs smoothly, please tell us any special delivery instructions when you place your order. For example, letting us know your home is in a gated complex and your driver will need to ring your buzzer for access, or if you’re leaving your stuff with a concierge, or in reception.

<p>YOrdering a delivery is simple! All you need to do is follow these 5-steps:


    Log into your LOVESPACE account
    In the drop-down menu, found in the top right-hand corner of the screen, click “MY STUFF”
    Then, click “WITH LOVESPACE”. You’ll see all your boxes currently in storage on this page
    Choose the boxes you’d like to be delivered back to you and click “RETURN”

<div class="card mb-5">
<p class="ms-4 mt-3 " data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#v"><b>Can you deliver my stuff back to a different address?</b></p>
<div id="v" class="collapse ms-3">
<p>Yes. If you’re on the move, that’s no problem at all. We’ll deliver your stuff to the ground floor of any address you like within the mainland UK, be it your home address, a business address or student accommodation. There’re only some locations we can’t arrange delivery to, such as airports and train stations. All we need is a residential or commercial address, postcode and someone available to sign for your delivery. If your stuff is being delivered to a location greater than 25 miles from the collection address, an additional charge of £5 per box or other item applies – bikes will cost an additional £60 per box.

    To deliver your stuff to a different address, simply enter a new address when placing your order. Get your files delivered to your office, your winter boots to your home and your surfboard to your favorite holiday spot!
