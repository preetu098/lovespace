                We can help with everyday storage needs too, like decluttering or redecorating the spare room.<br>
                
                We’ve been looking after people’s stuff for over a decade and we’re proud to have helped over 80,000 customers. </p>

                        LOVESPACE launched in 2011 as the UK’s first storage by-the-box service.<br>

                        Our company was founded by Streetcar (the former car-sharing company) entrepreneur Brett Akker and the founder of City Self-Storage, Carl August Ameln.<br>
                        
                        We wanted to bring flexibility to storage, allowing each customer to scale up and pay only for the space they actually need. This disrupted the traditional storage industry, where customers have no choice but to buy a huge amount of space that they usually won’t fill.<br>
                        
                        In 2013, former group director of strategy at Guardian Media Group, Steve Folwell, joined as Managing Director, and we launched our first full service.</p>

                        Over the past 10+ years, we’ve looked after thousands of UK college and university students’ stuff through our by-the-box service, collecting right from their doorstep and delivering back to wherever they are.

But as it’s not just students who need their stuff looking after, in 2021 we launched our storage units, for customers with bulkier items that won’t fit in a box.

Next came our first drive-up storage points for those with no time to waste and who want to drop their stuff off on their terms.

In 2022 so far, we’ve introduced more drive-up storage points across London and have big plans to take them national. We’ve also launched our removals service – helping renters, homeowners and business owners make their moves.

                            Choose from five unit sizes based on the amount of stuff you have, tell us the day you want us to collect it and we’ll be there.<br>

You can also add optional cardboard boxes at the same time or even pay for us to do all the packing for you.<br>

We store your items in a secure storage facility for as long as you like. When you want any of your stuff back, place a booking through your LOVESPACE account, select your item(s) and we'll deliver back to you as soon as the next day.
